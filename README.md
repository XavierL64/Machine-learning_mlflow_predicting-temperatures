# Machine-learning_mlflow_predicting-temperatures

The aim of this project is to predict mean temperature in London based on historical data. We clean, explore and preprocess the data before we automate the training and evaluation of multiple machine learning models. We test a linear regression, decision tree regressor, and random forest regressor. This is done in an automated workflow using methods from sklearn and MLflow.
